                        General Information
                    </h1>
                    <p>Real-world clinical data is needed to understand the course of disease, assess clinical effectiveness of medicines and to remain alert to unexpected serious adverse events or frequencies of adverse events (Mult Scler 23 (2017)362).  The OPTIMISE Project Team, which has involved neurologists from several UK centres, was created to address this need for multiple sclerosis (MS) care.</p>
                    <p>A core objective of the OPTIMISE Team has been to encourage MS neurologists to comprehensively record standardised data on their patients and to share this in anonymised fashion with other clinicians and researchers to improve patient care and health outcomes.</p>
                    <p>The Team recognises that software tools for MS patient data entry and curation have been generated before and already are being used by some MS centres.  However, some of these have been developed by single centres only and others may have a more complex range of data fields than is needed for usual practice.  Neither are in wide-enough use.</p>
                    <p>The OPTIMISE Team therefore worked with a core group of MS neurologists and solicited views of patients, industry and regulators regarding the kinds of data that are needed to make clinical decisions, to meet needs for prospective pharmacovigilance and that are practical to acquire.  The Team explored ways of making them easier to record. With this input, an open-access software tool was developed to facilitate the capture of prospective longitudinal, standardized clinical data in MS. This tool can be downloaded here for use by clinicians for MS care research.</p>
                    <p>The tool will generate .csv output files.  Users are encouraged to share anonymized data with larger registry efforts, such as MSBase (https://www.msbase.org/) or the UK MS Register (for UK based clinicians, https://www.ukmsregister.org/Portal/Home).</p>
                    <p>Additional updates to the tool will be provided periodically.  The OPTIMISE Team also is working to develop joint research projects to encourage real world data collection in MS care. Users are encouraged to register through this website to receive updates on the tool or news about about studies using OPTIMISE or enhancements for data sharing.  Feedback regarding to software is welcome: please send comments by email to ******.</p>

                    <p class="lead">OPTIMISE is accessible throught this website in two forms: direct access to our demo servers and packaged containers.</p>
                    <p>To access our demo server, simply head <a href="/portal">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>If you are an IT professional and would rather deploy the application on premise you can get this done in four simple steps.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li value="1">Install Docker version <code>18.x.y-ce</code>.<br/><i>Instructions available <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">here</a>.</i><br/><br/></li>
                        <li>Then, install Docker Compose version <code>1.8.x</code>.<br/><i>Instructions available <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">here</a>.</i><br/><br/></li>
                        <li>Create a directory where you would want the Optimise data to be stored and <code>cd</code>> into it.<br/><br/></li>
                        <li>Finally, run this simple command in a privileged shell<br/><code>curl -s https://optimise-ms.org/install | bash</code> :<br/><br/></li>

                        <h4>How to access it ?</h4>
                        <p>After successfully executing the installation command the application will be available on port <code>8080</code>. This can be changed by directly editing the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file present in the installation directory.</p>

                        <p>At any point it is possible to upgrade to the latest version of Optimise by simply going to the same folder you created in step 1 and run the installation command of step 4 again.</p>

                    <p>OPTIMISE MS is a system for recording data including demographics, clinical events, treatments and tests according to CDISC standards for Multiple Sclerosis. OPTIMISE MS allows researchers to better monitor MS patients’ progress, record outcomes and evaluate treatments.</p>
                    <p>The user can enter demographic, medical history and family medical history, clinical event, visit, test and treatment data.</p>
                    <p>OPTIMISE MS can be used in two modes; the off-site mode when networking is enabled and the on-premise mode when networking is disabled.</p>

                    <p>Creation of the OPTIMISE Database tool was sponsored by Imperial College London and generously funded by Biogen. This project also has been supported by the Imperial College NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Brain Sciences Theme.  The core OPTIMISE Team exercising oversight over the software development project included Ruth Dobson (St George’s Hospital), Matt Craner (University of Oxford & Frimley Health Foundation Trust), James Overell (University of Glasgow), Gavin Giovannoni (Barts and The London Hospitals),  Cheryl Hemingway (Great Ormond Street Hospital), Yi-ke Guo (Imperial College Data Science Institute) and Paul Matthews (Imperial College London NIHR Biomedical Research Centre and Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine).  Developers on the project included May Young, Fengde Liu and Eleni Pissaridou (Imperial College Data Science Institute). All of the team have benefited from the input of many clinicians and patients with MS.</p>
