                        General Information
                    </h1>
                    <h4>Real World Clinical Data</h4>
                    <p>Real-world clinical data is needed to understand the course of disease, assess clinical effectiveness of medicines and to remain alert to unexpected serious adverse events or frequencies of adverse events <a href="https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/handle/10044/1/44898">https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/handle/10044/1/44898</a>. The OPTIMISE Project Team, which has involved neurologists from several UK centres, was created to address this need for multiple sclerosis (MS) care.</p>
                    <h4>Addressing the Need for Prospective Pharmacovigilance Monitoring with DMT Use</h4>
                    <p>The primary objective of the OPTIMISE Team has been to encourage MS neurologists to record comprehensive, standardised data on their patient. This will enable sharing of anonymised data with other clinicians and researchers to answer the questions importing for improving patient care and health outcomes. The OPTIMISE Team has focused particularly on collecting data to assist in monitoring of benefits and risks of disease modifying therapies for prospective pharmacoviligance monitoring.</p>
                    <h4>OPTIMISE MS Clinical Research Data Management Software</h4>
                    <p>While software tools for MS patient data entry and curation have been generated before, none are in wide-enough use. One major challenge is to balance comprehensiveness of data collection with the sustainability of data entry in a busy clinic environment. Another is to ensure compliance with basic requirements for data security, audit and the ability to remove data fully if consent is withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>The OPTIMISE Team has worked with a core group of MS neurologists and solicited views of patients, industry and regulators regarding the kinds of data that are needed to make clinical decisions, to meet needs for prospective pharmacovigilance and that are practical to acquire. The Team explored ways of making them easier to record. OPTIMISE software developers then implemented these user requirements as the software downloadable here. This tool now is freely available for use by clinicians for MS care research.</p>
                    <p>The tool is provided “as is” as open access code under the terms of an MIT License (Open Source Initiative). The open access software provides users with a secure path to “future proofing” the software by giving control to them.</p>
                    <p>The OPTIMISE software will generate .json output files. Users are encouraged to share anonymized data with larger registry efforts, such as MSBase <a href="https://www.msbase.org/">https://www.msbase.org/</a> or the UK MS Register (for UK based clinicians, <a href="https://www.ukmsregister.org/Portal/Home">https://www.ukmsregister.org/Portal/Home</a>).</p>
                    <p>Additional updates to the tool will be provided periodically. In registering as part of approval for the software download, the OPTIMISE team will receive your approval to hold your contact details to allow us to update you as the software is enhanced. Feedback regarding to software is welcome: please send comments by email to ******.</p>
                    <h4>Other Tools for Real World Data Collection</h4>
                    <p>The OPTIMISE Team also is working to develop other tools for real world data collection for MS care. A recent report describes personalised, continuous, quantitative gait speed analysis in the home environment using a simple, low cost accelerometer (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00561/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00561/full</a>). Software and sample data for researchers who wish to explore this area is available (<a href="https://github.com/akaraspt/ms-gait-calibrate">https://github.com/akaraspt/ms-gait-calibrate</a>).</p>

                    <p class="lead">OPTIMISE is accessible through this website in two forms: direct access to our demo servers and packaged containers.</p>
                    <p>To access our demo server, simply head <a href="/portal">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>If you are an IT professional and would rather deploy the application on premise you can get this done in four simple steps.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li value="1">Install Docker version <code>18.x.y-ce</code>.<br/><i>Instructions available <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">here</a>.</i><br/><br/></li>
                        <li>Then, install Docker Compose version <code>1.8.x</code>.<br/><i>Instructions available <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">here</a>.</i><br/><br/></li>
                        <li>Create a directory where you would want the Optimise data to be stored and <code>cd</code>> into it.<br/><br/></li>
                        <li>Finally, run this simple command in a privileged shell<br/><code>curl -s https://optimise-ms.org/install | bash</code> :<br/><br/></li>

                        <h4>How to access it ?</h4>
                        <p>After successfully executing the installation command the application will be available on port <code>8080</code>. This can be changed by directly editing the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file present in the installation directory.</p>

                        <p>At any point it is possible to upgrade to the latest version of Optimise by simply going to the same folder you created in step 1 and run the installation command of step 4 again.</p>

                    <p>Creation of the OPTIMISE Database tool was sponsored by Imperial College London and generously funded by Biogen. This project also has been supported by the Imperial College NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Brain Sciences Theme. The core OPTIMISE Team exercising oversight over the software development project included Ruth Dobson (St George’s Hospital), Matt Craner (University of Oxford & Frimley Health Foundation Trust), James Overell (University of Glasgow), Gavin Giovannoni (Barts and The London Hospitals), Cheryl Hemingway (Great Ormond Street Hospital), Yi-ke Guo (Imperial College Data Science Institute) and Paul Matthews (Imperial College London NIHR Biomedical Research Centre and Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine). Developers on the project included May Young, Fangde Liu, Chon Sou, Pierre-Marie Danieu, Eleni Pissaridou and Florian Guitton (Imperial College Data Science Institute). All of the team have benefited from the input of many clinicians and patients with MS.</p>
