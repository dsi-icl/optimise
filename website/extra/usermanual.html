                    <p>OPTIMISE MS is a system for recording data including demographics, clinical events, treatments and tests according to <a href="https://www.cdisc.org/">Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium</a> (CDISC) standards for Multiple Sclerosis. OPTIMISE MS allows researchers to better monitor MS patients’ progress, record outcomes and evaluate treatments.</p>
                    <p>The user can enter demographic, medical history and family medical history, clinical event, visit, test and treatment data.</p>
                    <p>OPTIMISE MS can be used in two modes; the offline mode when networking is enabled and the online mode when networking is disabled.</p>
                    <p>This guide assumes that the OPTIMISE MS system has been successfully configured as described at <a href="../index.html#getting-started">Getting started</a>. An administrator needs to be defined who can control permissions for data access and securely provide users with login details. The PC and login passwords should be kept securely.</p>
                    <h1 id="ug-login">Logging in</h1>
                    <p>To start using the OPTIMISE MS portal, first open your favourite modern <a href="../index.html#support">Browser</a>.</p>
                    <p>Then, enter the hosting address in the address bar.</p>
                    <p>You should see the following screen.</p>
                    <img src="../img/loginPage.png" alt="login"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Enter the user name and password (in the boxes as shown below) that were given to you and click the Login button. The default username is <em>admin</em> and the default password is <em>admin</em>.</p>
                    <img src="../img/credentials.png" alt="credentials"><br/><br/>
                    <p>If the log-in is unsuccessful, you will get a message as shown below. Re-enter user credentials and click Login.</p>
                    <img src="../img/loginFail.png" alt="loginFail"><br/><br/>
                    <p>If the log-in is successful, you should see the following screen.</p>
                    <img src="../img/homePage.png" alt="initial"><br/><br/>
                    <h1 id="ug-search">Searching patients</h1>
                    <p>You can search the database using the user-friendly search tool available after successful log-in.</p>
                    <img src="../img/searchTool.png" alt="searchTool"><br/><br/>
                    <p>To search by patient ID, select Patient ID from the drop-down list labelled as 'Search by:'.</p>
                    <img src="../img/searchBy.png" alt="searchBy"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Click on the box labelled 'Containing'- this is below the 'Search by' list- and enter the patient ID you want to search for.</p>
                    <img src="../img/searchPatient.png" alt="searchBox"><br/><br/>
                    <p>The development team have assumed that an NHS ID will be used as patient ID to create, search and enter patient data. However, the software stores an independently generated, pseudonymised OPTIMISE ID along with the patient ID entered by the user at patient creation time.</p>
                    <p>The generated OPTIMISE ID is included in the exported data (more about the export in the section <a href="#ug-export">Exporting patient data</a>). Search by this generated ID is also possible. Select Anonymised ID from the drop-down 'Search by' list and enter the ID you see in the exported files in the 'Containing' box. This allows retrieval of the patient ID- the patient ID is shown in the search results.</p>
                    <p>As you type in search value box ('Containing' box), the patients with ID that contain the text you entered will be shown in the area below the search box. Basic patient information for each listed ID is also shown. If no patients are listed, then there are no patients with that ID already in the database. You can begin to enter data for a new patient, by entering the ID- please see the section <a href="#ug-createPatient">Creating a new patient</a>.</p>
                    <img src="../img/searchPatientResults.png" alt="searchResults"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Search by fields other than Patient ID and Anonymised ID (generated OPTIMISE ID) is also available. The example below refers to a search by country of origin with search value 'Canada'. The search results include two patients; patients with IDs OPTIMISE1 and OPTIMISE2.</p>
                    <img src="../img/searchCountry.png" alt="searchCountry"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Choose from the list of patient IDs below the search box by clicking on the patient box. To view and/or enter data for patient with ID OPTIMISE1, for example, click on the respective box (highlighted).</p>
                    <img src="../img/searchPatientResultsBox.png" alt="searchPatientResultsBox"><br/><br/>
                    <p>The timeline and a summary of the patient's Medical History will be available in the left panel. An overview that includes the patient profile, the primary diagnosis and other sections is available in the right panel. You may add, edit, or delete data for these sections as described in <a href="#ug-enterPatientData">Entering patient data</a>.</p>

                    <p>Fill the form in the right panel. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate are required fields. Click Submit to save the visit data or click X at the top right corner to return to the patient Overview without saving the visit data.</p>
                    <img src="../img/visitForm.png" alt="visitForm"><br/><br/>
                    <p>If the visit is successfully created, it will be added to the Medical History Summary in the main panel and to the Timeline. Baseline visits are labelled as such.</p>
                    <img src="../img/visitAdded.png" alt="visitAdded"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Symptoms and Signs are recorded only at a high level in the OPTIMISE MS database in an attempt to maximise the efficiency of their recording in the clinic and thus encourage their completeness. Symptoms reported by the patient and Signs observed by the neurologist are recorded separately.</p>
                    <p>Click on 'Edit symptoms data for this visit' or 'Edit signs data for this visit' buttons to enter Symptoms or Signs, respectively, elicited at the visit. For baseline visits, these will be labelled as 'First symptoms/signs indicating MS'. For non-baseline clinical visits, they will be labelled simply as Symptoms/Signs.</p>
                    <img src="../img/visitSS.png" alt="symptomsSigns"><br/><br/>                           
                    <p>Enter any present symptoms by clicking on the buttons or selecting a value from the drop-down lists in the right panel form. For example, the neurologist might have observed fatigue for the patient. Scroll down to the end of the form and click Save. To exit the form and return to the Patient Overview, click X at the top right corner. The form can be edited at a later time.</p>
                    <img src="../img/symptoms.png" alt="symptoms"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Similarly, enter any signs by filling and saving the Signs form in the right panel. As an example, the patient might have shown evidence for cognitive dysfunction with impairment of memory and had reduced sensitivity to the colour red with the left eye.</p>
                    <img src="../img/signs.png" alt="signs"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Click on 'Edit performance measures data for this visit' to enter Performance Measures data.</p>
                    <img src="../img/perfMeasures.png" alt="perfMeasures"><br/><br/>
                    <p>The EDSS can be entered in two ways; the neurologist’s estimated EDSS or the calculated EDSS. The neurologist’s estimated EDSS score can be entered in the highlighted box in the right panel form.</p>
                    <img src="../img/estimatedEDSS.png" alt="estimatedEDSS"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Click Save for this estimated EDSS to be recorded. In addition, or alternatively, the functional systems can be scored separately and the total EDSS can be calculated by clicking on Open EDSS Calculator.</p>
                    <img src="../img/openCalc.png" alt="EDSScalculator"><br/><br/>
                    <p>For this, select a score for each EDSS subcategory. Hover over a score button to see the respective score description highlighted. The calculated total score will be shown in the Calculated score box. Note that an Ambulation score is required for the functional scores to be saved. Click Save to record the scores and then X to exit the calculator. To exit Performance Measuresand return to the Patient Overview, click on X at the top right corner of the EDSS form.</p>
                    <img src="../img/edssCalculator.png" alt="edssCalculator"><br/><br/>                    
                    <p>The EDSS Total and EDSS Subscores will be listed under Performance Measures in the Medical History Summary.</p>

                    <p>OPTIMISE MS supports the generation of a free-text visit report, called a Communication. This can be exported as a .txt file. You may also copy and paste the entered text directly in a document such as a clinic letter generated by other software.</p>
                    <p>Click on 'Edit or export the visit report' to edit or export a Communication for the visit.</p>
                    <img src="../img/communication.png" alt="communication"><br/><br/>
                    <p>Specific field data entered for the patient from a visit can be added automatically to the Communication by selecting the appropriate buttons above the text area.</p>
                    <img src="../img/communication1.png" alt="communicationReport"><br/><br/>          
                    <p>Click on the buttons to add the respective recorded data to the report. You may format the text using the available formatting tools. The report can be updated at a later time to include data entered after its creation.</p>
