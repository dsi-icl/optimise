                        <p>Optimise MS is a system for recording data including demographics, clinical events,
                            treatments and
                            tests in a fashion interoperable with
                            <a href="https://www.cdisc.org/">Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)</a>
                            standards for Multiple Sclerosis.
                            Optimise MS allows researchers to better monitor MS patients’ progress, record outcomes and
                            evaluate
                            treatments.
                        </p>
                        <p>Users can enter demographic, medical history, clinical event, visit,
                            test and treatment data.</p>
                        <p>Optimise MS can be used in various settings and you can choose to install it in offline mode
                            as a desktop application, useful when a network connection is not available enabled or in
                            online mode, installed on your IT department servers usable by a whole team simultaneously.
                        </p>
                        <p>This guide assumes that the Optimise MS system has been successfully configured as described
                            at <a href="/#getting-started">Getting started</a>. An administrator needs to be defined who
                            can control permissions for data access and securely provide users with login details. The
                            PC and login passwords should be kept securely.

                        <p>A patient identifier is required when creating a new patient in Optimise MS. The term Patient
                            ID, used in this guide, refers to this identifier which may correspond to the patient's NHS
                            ID, CHI ID or otherwise qualified hospital identifier. Optimise MS stores an independently
                            generated pseudo-anonymised ID along with the patient ID entered by the user at patient
                            creation time - this generated identifier is referred to as Optimise ID.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Optimise ID is included in the exported data (more about the export in the section <a
                                href="#ug-export">Exporting patient data</a>). Note that you can retrieve the original
                            patient ID using the <a href="ug-search">Search tool</a> by searching the corresponding
                            Optimise ID; you must be an administrator on the system to carry out this de-anonymisation
                            operation.

                            of this folder- the default is attachment.zip. Please note that any Patient Identifiable
