                        <h4>Real World Clinical Data</h4>
                        <p>Real-world clinical data is needed to understand the course of disease, assess clinical
                            effectiveness
                            of medicines and to remain alert to unexpected serious adverse events or frequencies of
                            adverse
                            events (see A. Gafson et al.
                            <i>Multiple Sclerosis Journal</i> 23 (2017) 362-369,

                            The Optimise MS Project Team, which
                            has involved neurologists from several UK centres, was created to address this need for
                            multiple
                            sclerosis (MS) care.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Addressing the Need for Prospective Pharmacovigilance Monitoring with DMT Use</h4>
                        <p>The primary objective of the Optimise MS Team has been to encourage MS neurologists to record
                            comprehensive,
                            standardised data on their patients. This will enable sharing of anonymised data with other
                            clinicians
                            and researchers to answer questions important for improving patient care and health
                            outcomes.
                            The Optimise MS Team has focused particularly on collecting data to assist in monitoring of
                            benefits
                            and risks of disease modifying therapies for prospective pharmacovigilance monitoring.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Optimise MS Clinical Research Data Management Software</h4>
                        <p>While software tools for MS patient data entry and curation have been generated before, none
                            are
                            in wide-enough use. One major challenge is to balance comprehensiveness of data collection
                            with
                            the sustainability of data entry in a busy clinic environment. Another is to ensure
                            compliance
                            with basic requirements for data security and auditing and the ability to remove data if
                            consent
                            is withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>The Optimise MS Team has worked with a core group of MS neurologists and solicited views of
                            patients,
                            industry and regulators regarding the kinds of data that are needed to make clinical
                            decisions,
                            to meet needs for prospective pharmacovigilance and that are practical to acquire. The Team
                            explored
                            ways of making them easier to record. Optimise MS software developers then implemented these
                            user requirements as the software downloadable here. This tool now is freely available for
                            use
                            by clinicians for MS care research.</p>
                        <p>The tool is provided “as is” as open access code under the terms of an MIT License (Open
                            Source Initiative).
                            The open access software provides users with a secure path to “future proofing” the software
                            by giving control to them.</p>
                        <p>The Optimise MS software will generate .json output files. Users are encouraged to share
                            anonymized
                            data with larger registry efforts, such as MSBase (
                            <a href="https://www.msbase.org/">https://www.msbase.org/</a>) or the UK MS Register (for UK
