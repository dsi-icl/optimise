An excellent resource to guide your first steps
using the Optimise MS application for data collection

Optimise MS is a system for recording data including demographics, clinical events, treatments and tests in a fashion interoperable with [Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)](https://www.cdisc.org/) standards for Multiple Sclerosis. Optimise MS allows researchers to better monitor MS patients’ progress, record outcomes and evaluate treatments.

Users can enter demographic, medical history, clinical event, visit, test and treatment data.

Optimise MS can be used in various settings and you can choose to install it in offline mode as a desktop application, useful when a network connection is not available enabled or in online mode, installed on your IT department servers usable by a whole team simultaneously.

This guide assumes that the Optimise MS system has been successfully configured as described at [Getting started](https://optimise.dsi.ic.ac.uk/#getting-started). An administrator needs to be defined who can control permissions for data access and securely provide users with login details. The PC and login passwords should be kept securely.

Patient identifiers 
===================

A patient identifier is required when creating a new patient in Optimise MS. The term Patient ID, used in this guide, refers to this identifier which may correspond to the patient's NHS ID, CHI ID or otherwise qualified hospital identifier. Optimise MS stores an independently generated pseudo-anonymised ID along with the patient ID entered by the user at patient creation time - this generated identifier is referred to as Optimise ID.

The Optimise ID is included in the exported data (more about the export in the section [Exporting patient data](#export)). Note that you can retrieve the original patient ID using the [Search tool](search) by searching the corresponding Optimise ID; you must be an administrator on the system to carry out this de-anonymisation operation.

Searching patients
==================

You can search the database using the user-friendly search tool available after successful log-in.

![searchTool bordered](./img/searchTool.png)


To search by patient ID, select Patient ID from the drop-down list labelled as 'Search by:'.

![searchBy bordered](./img/searchBy.png)


Click on the box labelled 'Containing'- this is below the 'Search by' list- and enter the patient ID you want to search for.

![searchBox bordered](./img/searchPatient.png)


As you type in search value box ('Containing' box), the patients with ID that contain the text you entered will be shown in the area below the search box. Basic patient information for each listed ID is also shown. If no patients are listed, then there are no patients with that ID already in the database. You can begin to enter data for a new patient, by entering the ID- please see the section [Creating a new patient](#createPatient).

![searchResults bordered](./img/searchPatientResults.png)


Data files generated by Optimise MS using the [Export option](#export) do not include the [patient ID](#patientID). Should you wish to retrieve the Patient ID, you can do so using the Search tool. You will need to obtain the Optimise ID (labelled 'USUBJID' in the CDISC standard) and search by 'Optimise ID' in the drop-down list.

Search by fields other than Patient ID and Optimise ID (generated Optimise ID) is also available. The example below refers to a search by country of origin with search value 'Canada'. The search results include two patients; patients with IDs Optimise1 and Optimise2.

![searchCountry bordered](./img/searchCountry.png)


Choose from the list of patient IDs below the search box by clicking on the patient box. To view and/or enter data for patient with ID Optimise1, for example, click on the respective box (highlighted).

![searchPatientResultsBox bordered](./img/searchPatientResultsBox.png)


The timeline and a summary of the patient's Medical History will be available in the left panel. An overview that includes the patient profile, the primary MS diagnosis and other sections is available in the right panel (see next screenshot). You may add, edit, or delete data for these sections as described in [Entering patient data](#enterPatientData).

To exit the patient's (here, Optimise1) records and return to the Patient Search page where you can search and create patients, click on ![examplePatientProfileClose](./img/xButton.png) which is located near the top center of the page as shown below.

Using the Timeline
==================

You may click on the coloured shapes or EDSS on the Timeline to access (view/edit) the corresponding entry in Medical History Summary. The computed total EDSS is plotted at the bottom part of the timeline. If the computed total EDSS is not available (i.e. the calculator was not used or the user chose not to save the calculated score), then the estimated EDSS is plotted.

![timeline bordered](./img/timeline.png)


Click on ![timelineIcon](./img/timelineIcon.png) next to Timeline to maximise the timeline. The horizontal end point (right) of the timeline is the current date. The timeline covers the last month by default. Therefore, any data recorded during this period is shown. You may change this behaviour by reading the guide below the graph.

![timelineExpand bordered](./img/timeline1.png)


Follow the instructions below the timeline to interact with it. Zooming in and zooming out as well as navigation to a specific time period are available. The timeline shows Treatments, Visits, Tests, Clinical Events (Relapses and Adverse Events) and EDSS using different colouring.

Zooming out allows the depiction of a larger part of the patient's Medical History. For example, the patient's medical history for the year 2017 is shown below.

![timelineOneYear bordered](./img/timeline2.png)


Further zooming-out gives a graphical overview of the complete medical history.

======================

Optimise MS currently supports the export of patient data in JSON and CSV files. This is available in the right panel on the Patient Search page.

![exportAll bordered](./img/exportAll.png)


In order to export the database as JSON and CSV files, click on the export button (highlighted) and choose where to save the ZIP folder which you can then extract. You may want to change the name of this folder- the default is attachment.zip. Please note that any Patient Identifiable Information is excluded from the generated JSON and CSV files by default.

![exportAllButton bordered](./img/exportAllButton.png)


The patient ID is not included in any of the export output files; the Optimise ID (an pseudo-anonymised generated ID) replaces the patient ID as described in the section [Patient identifiers](#patientID). The column USUBJID (Unique Subject Identifier) in the exported treatment data CSV file stores Optimise ID.

You can find the respective patient ID using the search tool as described in the section [Searching patients](#search).

The option to export part of the database becomes available if you start using the search tool.

Click on

![exportSearchButton bordered](./img/exportSearchButton.png)


in the right panel to export the data stored for the patients listed in the search results area below the search tool.

You may export data based on a search by fields such as ID and treatment. Here, for example, only the data for patients diagnosed with RRMS can be exported by clicking the appropriate Export button in the right panel.

### MedDRA Management

The admin menu has a section allowing the management of MedDRA codings for users posessing a license.
See the [dedicated section](#meddra) of this manual pertaining to MedDRA codings management.

<a class="anchor" id="patientMapping"></a>

### Patient ID Mappings

While it is not recommended to do so and should be avoided at all times. The software offers the possibility to bulk export the patient ID to optimise ID mappings. You should never do this !

<a class="anchor" id="synchronisation"></a>

### Synchronisation

For sites that wish to utilise data synchronisation to upload data to a central repository the configuration can be done in the Sunchronisation section.
The "Remote Host" and "Validation Key" are information you should seek from your system administrator.

![syncPage bordered](./img/syncPage.png)

Once configured, synchronisation should be automatic in most cases. You will see a status indicator in the application's status bar.

![syncRemoteSyncing bordered](./img/syncRemoteSyncing.png)

If the status bar indicator mentions the remote site is unavailable you may want to contact your administrator for further investigation.

![syncRemoteNotAvailable bordered](./img/syncRemoteNotAvailable.png)

The synchronisation configuration page also features a button that can use to trigger synchronisation manually should this be necessary.

Managing MedDRA Codings (admin only)
====================================

The initial installation does not come with MedDra coding, due to license reason. The software comes with an opt-in upload of the MedDRA codes, after which users can select desired code in clinical events. NB upload can only be done by admin.

In the Admin Menu, select "Manage MedDRA codings"; you will then see the following panel.

![uploadMeddraOnlyMdhier bordered](./img/uploadMeddraOnlyMdhier.png)

Depending on your subscription to MedDRA and your preference of the granularity of the codings that will be in the application, select the appropriate option. Mdhier.asc contains all the terms higher than "Low-level terms" and llt.asc contains all the "Low-level terms" (in MedDRA terminology).

![uploadMeddraWithLlt bordered](./img/uploadMeddraWithLlt.png)

Select the appropriate files of the indicated name in the files provided by MedDRA and click submit. The application will start to process the file. When you see the following message, the upload is finished:

![uploadMeddraWithLlt bordered](./img/meddraUploadDone.png)

When you get a new version of MedDRA, you can update the codings in the application by doing the same steps. If some patients already have MedDRA coding data associated with them, it will be indicated that it is an old coding. If you decide to edit the MedDRA for a patient, you will only be able to select from the new codings:
